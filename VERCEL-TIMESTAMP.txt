The index.html file has been restored to proper template format.
This should fix the Vercel build issues.

Changes made:
- Fixed index.html template (removed hardcoded /Intervue/assets/ paths)
- Vercel build should now work with /assets/ paths

This file forces a new commit to trigger Vercel deployment.
