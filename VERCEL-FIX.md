# Vercel Deployment Fix

This commit contains the necessary fixes for Vercel deployment:

1. Updated vercel.json with explicit build command: `npx vite build --base=/`
2. Fixed package.json build script to use npx
3. Enhanced vite.config.js with proper build configuration
4. All paths now use `/assets/` instead of `/Intervue/assets/`

## Expected Result
Vercel should now build successfully without the path resolution errors.
