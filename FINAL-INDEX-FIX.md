# FINAL INDEX.HTML FIX

Fixed the corrupted index.html file that contained hardcoded build paths.

## What was wrong:
- The index.html file contained hardcoded `/Intervue/assets/` paths from a previous build
- This caused Vite to fail during build because it couldn't resolve these hardcoded paths

## What was fixed:
- Restored index.html to proper template format with `/src/main.jsx` entry point
- Now builds correctly with `/assets/` paths (no /Intervue/ prefix)
- Vercel deployment should now work

Build output now shows correct paths:
- `/assets/index-1RHu3bxy.js` ✓
- `/assets/index-BKEdzEjZ.css` ✓
